        Hello, there!
        Here is a new feature.
        Used the following commands:
        git branch 
        git chekcout
        git merge
        <p>
            <h3>Remotes:</h3>
            Like origin. It is the place where we 'pull' our data from.
            <h3>Forks:</h3>
            Create a new repository, separate version. Both repos are independent.
            <h3>Pull Requests:</h3>
            Your changes to be brought from one branch or same or different repository.
            "I have made these changes, I would like for someone to review these changes,
            before merging into the master branch."
